Code Review
===========

.. warning::
   This chapter is in draft status.

Code review is a software quality assurance activity during
which a program is evaluate against a standardized list of
expectations. During the evaluation, the program is carefully
inspected for bugs that the original developer overlooked.
Without standards to uphold, code reviewers will miss defects 
due to improper code review techniques.

This chapter begins with a thorough description of code review
and its benefits; then, it discusses how to initiate a code 
review followed by an extensive walk-through on how to perform a 
code review from start to finish.

Modern Code Review
------------------

In the past, the author of a code change would sit down
with reviewers to go through the code and find defects. However,
it was found that code reviews with meetings consumed significantly
more time and money than code reviews without meetings without
providing a significant increase in defect detection
[Johnson-Tjahjono]_. As a solution, code reviewers began to employ
tools to make the process asynchronous, which means the reviewer
can inspect code at any time. Through the use of source control
tools, code writers began to make small, relevant changes
rather than large, intricate changes. This approach came to
be known as *modern code review*.

Both open-source and industry software projects utilize modern code 
review [Sadowski-Soderberg-Bacchelli]_â€”and for good reasons: the
reported benefits from reviewing code are abundant. While code reviews
require a large time investment, an impressive return on investment has
been shown. For instance, at Hewlett-Packard, code review was found to
reduce the time for an application to get to market by 1.8 months
[Grady-Van-Slack]_. It was further shown that code review has many positive
side effects. Researchers at Microsoft have found that code review
acts as a transfer of knowledge between the code reviewer and reviewee,
increases team participation, and helps provide a productive way of
finding alternative solutions to problems [Bacchelli-Bird]_. The magnitude
of these benefits greatly depends on the skill-level of the code reviewers
involved. Therefore, it is critical to choose highly experienced reviewers
when submitting code for inspection.

Locating overlooked defects is the main motive for reviewing code submitted
for inspection. These defects are generally split into two categories:
*functionality* and *evolvability defects*. When discussing *functionality 
defects* during an inspection, the code reviewer is typically indicating 
that a code of code has logical issues. On the other hand, *evolvability
defects* describe issues with the organization of code or the contents of
documentation [Mantyla-Lassenius]_. Of the two kinds of defects, evolvability
defects are the most damaging to a project over the course of the development
life cycle. This is due to the large time investment required in order to
rewrite a piece of software that has matured around evolvability defects.
Unfortunately, they also happen to be the most common; therefore, most of
efforts of code review are spent locating these kinds of bugs.

How To Start A Code Review
--------------------------

General Steps To Start A Code Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#.  Make sure your local commits have been pushed to your working branch/fork.
    You can accomplish this by running:
    ::

        $ git push origin HEAD

#.  Using a project's respective version control 
    service (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket), create a
    pull request to merge your commits into the parent
    version. Provide a title for what the feature adds 
    and a longer description with a change
    log. :numref:`pullrequest` and :numref:`pullrequestform`
    demonstrate an example pull request in GitHub.

    .. _pullrequest:
    .. figure:: cr/figures/pullrequest.png
       
       Press "Compare & Pull Request" to review your changes
       and submit a pull request.


    .. _pullrequestform:
    .. figure:: cr/figures/pullrequestform.png
       
       Pull requests should have a title summarizing the 
       new feature and a comment giving a more descriptive
       explanation of the changes the pull request will make.


#.  Request for another developer of the project to review
    your changes. Ideally, they should be an expert of the
    methods used to create the changes.

#.  Wait for (or bug) the assigned code reviewer to look over
    your changes. They may ask for you to clarify your methods
    or ask for you to make additional changes, so make sure you
    regularly check the pull request until it is rejected or
    accepted.

Making Nano-Commits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Nano-committing* is the act of submitting code for review in small,
homogenous portions. In other words, the code is meant to complete 
a sub-task of the overarching feature being implemented. During the
development process, making nano-commits can you help keep track of
the work-flow. For instance, if a bug is found, then you can sift
through the small changes until the bug either disappears or changes.
This will help you make the necessary changes at the root, keeping
the fix clean.

Some tasks you may consider keeping as separate commits are:

-   Refracting code before making changes to its logic;
-   Adding or modifying documentation;
-   Fixing a bug or creating a small feature;
-   Or changing configuration settings.

Keep in mind that you, as the developer, are responsible for
making code as smooth to review as possible. Nano-commits can
aid the code reviewer to follow your work-flow easily. Furthermore, 
while smaller commit sizes greatly reduce the likelihood of
creating bugs [Purushothaman-Perry]_, they still pose a risk
and should be reviewed for correctness.

Ensuring Your Code Is Complete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before committing your code, it is wise to do a *personal code review* 
to locate as many issues as you can before passing it along to another 
person. In doing so, you will avoid potentially wasting time on several
more iterations of code review than necessary [Humphrey]_. While you
perform the personal code review, you should keep a checklist of
common mistakes to look for. By utilizing a checklist, you will 
ensure both efficiency and consistency from your personal code reviews.

Furthermore, it is important to be courteous of your code reviewer's 
time.  Your code should be ready for customers and void of any obvious
bugs. Ideally, the code reviewer should only have to make comments
regarding the implementation and not about major issues that need fixed. 
A study from Microsoft found that only around 15% of comments 
during code review address bugs [Czerwonka-Greiler-Tilford]_, which
indicates a greater emphasis on other areas, such as code styling or
long-term maintainability. It is also important to keep the responsibilities
of the code review in mind: it is not their job to fix your bugs; their
purpose is to notice and bring small, easy-to-miss issues to your attention
for you to go back and fix. If you submit incomplete code with known
issues, then you waste both your and your code reviewer's time. In
order to collaborate as a team and achieve results, it is important to
remain considerate of your collaborators efforts [Dreu-Weingart]_.

A change that causes external features to fail is a less obvious 
sign of incomplete code. With an extensive system of unit tests, 
these issues are more obvious by validating that a change does not 
damage older features. With this in mind, it is vital to implement 
unit tests alongside new features. Implementation of unit tests 
guarantees protection from hidden bugs. In a similar vein, failure 
to compile is another sign of a project containing incomplete code.
The error output of the compiler will normally indicate where the
issue is located, so it is vital to read and understand what it says.
It is crucial to verify that none of the unit tests fail and the
build successfully compiles *before* submitting the change for
a code review.
